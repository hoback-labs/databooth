## Vision: The Full DataBooth Experience

### What DataBooth Actually Delivers

Not charts. Stories.

**Story Outputs:**
- Headline insight (the one thing that matters)
- "So what" narrative (why it matters, what it means)
- Supporting visuals (charts as evidence, not the main event)
- Strategic implications (what to do about it)
- Talking points and speaker notes (for the keynote)
- Analogies and examples (that make it land for your audience)
- Trends + future outlook (where this is heading)
- Recommended actions (what to do next)

### Audience-First Framing

Same data, completely different outputs:

| Audience | What They Get |
|----------|---------------|
| **Executive** | 3 numbers, 1 insight, 30 seconds. Big KPIs, trend arrow, one sentence. |
| **Board** | Quarterly story, governance lens. YoY comparison, risk flags, projections. |
| **Client** | Polished, branded, "worth what I paid." Clean design, professional feel. |
| **Technical** | Show me the data, all of it. Dense tables, drill-downs, methodology notes. |
| **Investor** | Growth story, unit economics. Hockey sticks, CAC/LTV, runway. |
| **Social Media** | Bold, simple, shareable. One stat, big font, mobile-optimized. |

The AI doesn't just pick chart types - it picks *information density*, *tone*, *what to hide*, *what to emphasize*.

### Medium-Optimized Packaging

"The medium is the message" - same story, different packaging:

- **Digital signage** - Lobby dashboards, kiosk displays, always-on screens
- **Slide decks** - Keynote, PowerPoint, Google Slides with speaker notes
- **Print-ready** - PDF executive summaries, high-res PNG/SVG for print
- **Social media cards** - Instagram, LinkedIn, X - optimized dimensions, bold visuals
- **Embeddable widgets** - Drop into your website or app
- **Animated GIFs** - For presentations and social sharing

### Data Sources (Vision)

Beyond CSV upload:
- Google Sheets / Excel links
- Airtable, Notion databases
- Direct database connections
- API integrations (Stripe, Shopify, HubSpot, Salesforce)
- Dead simple "connect your data" flow (like OAuth - click, authorize, done)
